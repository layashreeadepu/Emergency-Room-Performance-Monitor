# ✨ Emergency Room Performance Monitor ✨

## 🌟 Project Summary

**Optimizing Hospital Emergency Room Efficiency through Interactive Visual Analytics**

This project delivers a full-scale Power BI solution aimed at improving operational transparency, decision-making, and patient experience within emergency departments. By connecting healthcare administrators to real-time performance insights, the dashboard bridges gaps in resource allocation, wait time management, and referral tracking. 🚑📊

## 📌 Motivation

Hospitals constantly face the challenge of balancing capacity with care quality—especially in emergency departments where lives depend on timeliness. During periods of high demand, ERs often seem underutilized due to backend inefficiencies, while general wards become bottlenecks for admitted patients. Decision-makers are left in the dark with outdated reports and fragmented views across departments.

This project emerged to address these **real-world gaps in visibility and performance tracking**. Through data storytelling and strategic KPIs, the dashboard empowers hospitals to monitor and act on key emergency room dynamics in a timely, data-driven manner.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

The design process began by identifying core performance questions hospital staff struggle with:

* What percentage of patients are being admitted vs. discharged?
* Are wait times improving over time or clustering during specific shifts?
* Which departments receive the most referrals—and are they creating bottlenecks?
* Do patient demographics correlate with service delays or outcomes?

To answer these, the project integrates multi-layered analytics:

* **Admission Patterns**: Evaluated changes in hospital intake behavior
* **Referral Flow Mapping**: Modeled how patients travel across specialties post-ER
* **Timeliness Metrics**: Quantified patient journey stages from arrival to referral
* **Equity & Demographics**: Assessed how service delivery varies across age, gender, and race
* **Performance Trends**: Enabled longitudinal trend review with slicers for monthly and hourly analysis

The result is a **cohesive dashboard that doesn’t just display data—it tells the story of care delivery.**

## 📂 Features

* 📆 **Customizable Date Filters**: Zoom in on patterns by month, day, or shift
* 🧍 **Patient-Level Drilldowns**: Explore demographic or individual-level insights
* 🧾 **Referral Network View**: Visualize internal movement of patients by specialty
* 📤 **Export-Ready Layout**: Supports report sharing for clinical and board reviews
* 📌 **Comparative Analysis Tools**: Highlight performance differences by race, age, and gender
